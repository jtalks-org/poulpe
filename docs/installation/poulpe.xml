  <!--This is a cache configuration file, it's required because JCommune and Poulpe are using shared distributed cache
    to communicate with updates. Thus, uncomment it if you need both Poulpe and JCommune running together at the same
    time. It should be similar to this config:
    https://github.com/jtalks-org/poulpe/blob/master/poulpe-model/src/main/resources/org/jtalks/poulpe/model/entity/ehcache.xml
    The port inside of this file might require changing to the same as JCommune uses. Or vice versa-->
